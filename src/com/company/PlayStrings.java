     * Your task is to Combine two Strings. But consider the rule...
     *
     * By the way you don't have to check errors or incorrect input
     * values, everything is ok without bad tricks, only two input strings
     * and as result one output string;-)...
     *
     * And here's the rule:
     * Input Strings a and b: For every character in string a swap the casing
     * of every occurrence of the same character in string b. Then do the same
     * casing swap with the inputs reversed. Return a single string consisting of
     * the changed version of a followed by the changed version of b. A char of a
     * is in b regardless if it's in upper or lower case - see the testcases too.
     * I think that's all;-)...
     *
     * Some easy examples:
     *
     * Input: "abc" and "cde"      => Output: "abCCde"
     * Input: "ab" and "aba"       => Output: "aBABA"
     * Input: "abab" and "bababa"  => Output: "ABABbababa"
     * Once again for the last example - description from KenKamau, see discourse;-):
